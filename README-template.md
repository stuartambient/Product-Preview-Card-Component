## My process

Not sure I had a process to start except choosing what I considered basic enough to get my feet wet. I already have some html and css knowledge. I created a local project and tested and tweaked mostly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Using more of flexbox, including spending some time reading up on the flex shorhand (grow, shrink and basis)

- Responsive design - particularly writing media queries.

- Responsive images - After seeing someone else's code I decided to try and use srcset along with the 'sizes' property. It was probably overkill for this challenge it was a good thing to learn for the future.

- I also read up on how to reset the CSS from the default browser styles.

- I tried to use all classes going for low specificity CSS. I used some basic BEM to name the classes. Think I need more practice in this area.

### Continued development

Just more css design in general.
